# Nice to meet you! I'm Silvia 👋

### A passionate frontend developer based in Barcelona, Spain ✨

😄 In 2022 I graduated from a bootcamp [IT Academy](https://cibernarium.barcelonactiva.cat/it-academy2), where I discovered the beauty of coding and programming. Shortly after, I started working as Front End Engineer for a software company.

I've always been interested in tech, but my passion for problem solving and my desire for learning have driven me to learn web development and change my career. And, I must say, the journey has been lovely so far!

**What's on my mind?**

🏅 I am approaching the 1-year milestone as Front End Engineer. Certainly the first months were mind-blowing, but now things are getting interesting as I can build more exciting things and I'm able to grasp complex concepts, especially in the languages I use everyday, TypeScript and JavaScript.

🔭 An idea that has been on my mind for a while already, is studying also backend development and more OOP. I want to understand the logic that runs in the server as well.

🌱 But in general, the beauty of being an engineer, is that no matter how deep your understanding is or what beautiful things you can build, there is always something left to learn. Some topics I'm focusing on at the moment:
   - **Foundations of Computer Science**: as Economics graduate, I love understanding why things add up, so I figured some programming theory wouldn't hurt. After a break due to my intense first months as Front End Engineer, I'm finally finishing [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/), Harvard's course for CS majors. Algorithms sharpen my mind, and I'm also learning the basics of C and Python. I'm definitely enjoying this course, and I'm looking for the next CS course to take.
   - **Clean coding**: I'm reading famous Uncle Bob's book, and taking some practical courses via O'Reilly. Refactoring everything I see would be a bit too much, but at least I try to leave the code I touch more readable than it was before.
   - **Web Accessibility**: this is a very important area for me. There is so much power and information on the Internet right now, we simply cannot forget to make everything we build, accessible for everyone. A great resource for that is A11Y Project, specifically their accessibility [checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/). If you are also interested in this, please get in touch either via email or Twitter, and let's change the web together!
  
🤗 I am a Community Hero (moderator) in the discord server of [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), an excellent interactive platform and a vibrant, helpful community. Their support was important to get me going during my learning journey, so in my free time I try to give my best support and advice to fellow learners and aspiring developers. If you're also a Scrimba member, please say hi :)

💬 You can ask me about **JavaScript, TypeScript and React.js**. Not too difficult questions though, I'm not a guru (yet! But I'm working on it 😉)
